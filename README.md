# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

---

## Solution Approach
- The program asks the user to enter a number.
- Input validation ensures only positive integers are accepted.
- A function `factorial(num)` is defined:
  - Uses a loop to multiply numbers from `1` to `num`.
  - Returns the factorial result.
- The result is printed in a formatted message.

##  How to Run
1. Save the script as `factorial.py`.
2. Run in terminal:
   ```bash
   python factorial.py
